          <h2>Chicken</h2>
          The chicken is a bird that people all over the world raise for its meat, eggs, and feathers. It belongs to the group of domesticated, or tame, birds called poultry.

          Chickens have short wings and a heavy body. This makes it hard for them to fly very far. Male chickens are called roosters. Roosters often have brightly colored feathers. They can be red, green, brown, black, or other colors. Female chickens are called hens. Hens are usually brown or white. Both males and females have one or two wattles. A wattle is skin that hangs from the throat. Male and female chickens also have a comb, which is skin that sticks up from the top of the head.
          
          Farmers usually keep chickens inside large, modern buildings. They feed the birds corn and other grains. Some farmers allow their chickens to roam free outdoors. These chickens usually roost, or sleep, inside at night.
          
          Hens can lay more than 200 eggs a year. If a hen mates with a rooster before laying eggs, the eggs will be fertilized. This means that they will develop into chicks. But hens can lay eggs without mating. These unfertilized eggs are the eggs that people eat.
          
          Wild birds called jungle fowl are the ancestors of chickens. Jungle fowl belong to the pheasant family. They live in parts of Asia, including India. Jungle fowl eat seeds, fruit, and insects. They fly into trees to escape from predators.
          So how did the classical Latin become so incoherent? According to McClintock, a 15th century typesetter likely scrambled part of Cicero's De Finibus in order to provide placeholder text to mockup various fonts for a type specimen book.

It's difficult to find examples of lorem ipsum in use before Letraset made it popular as a dummy text in the 1960s, although McClintock says he remembers coming across the lorem ipsum passage in a book of old metal type samples. So far he hasn't relocated where he once saw the passage, but the popularity of Cicero in the 15th century supports the theory that the filler text has been used for centuries.

And anyways, as Cecil Adams reasoned, “[Do you really] think graphic arts supply houses were hiring classics scholars in the 1960s?” Perhaps. But it seems reasonable to imagine that there was a version in use far before the age of Letraset.

McClintock wrote to Before & After to explain his discovery;

“What I find remarkable is that this text has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since some printer in the 1500s took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book; it has survived not only four centuries of letter-by-letter resetting but even the leap into electronic typesetting, essentially unchanged except for an occasional 'ing' or 'y' thrown in. It's ironic that when the then-understood Latin was scrambled, it became as incomprehensible as Greek; the phrase 'it's Greek to me' and 'greeking' have common semantic roots!” (The editors published his letter in a correction headlined “Lorem Oopsum”).
As an alternative theory, (and because Latin scholars do this sort of thing) someone tracked down a 1914 Latin edition of De Finibus which challenges McClintock's 15th century claims and suggests that the dawn of lorem ipsum was as recent as the 20th century. The 1914 Loeb Classical Library Edition ran out of room on page 34 for the Latin phrase “dolorem ipsum” (sorrow in itself). Thus, the truncated phrase leaves one page dangling with “do-”, while another begins with the now ubiquitous “lorem ipsum”.

Whether a medieval typesetter chose to garble a well-known (but non-Biblical—that would have been sacrilegious) text, or whether a quirk in the 1914 Loeb Edition inspired a graphic designer, it's admittedly an odd way for Cicero to sail into the 21st century.
